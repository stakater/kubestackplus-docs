# Backup and Restore

Back up and restore applications on Stakater App Agility Platform (AAP)

## Prerequisite

You need Velero CLI setup, follow the `velero-cli` [doc](./velero-cli.md)

## Service viewpoint

### Backup

Stakater App Agility Platforms divides backups into two:

1. Customer backups
1. Platform Tools backups

These Backups are stored on the Cloud Provider under your account.

#### Customer Backups

There are 3 default backup schedules for customers that are deployed with offered Velero tool:

| Schedule                       | Backup Frequency |   Backup Retention   | Backup Scope |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| Daily Customer Workload Backup | Every 24 hrs |   Last 7 Backup(s) | Objects + PV Snapshots |
| Hourly Full Cluster Object Backup | Every hour | Last 24 Backup(s) | Objects |
| Weekly Full Backup | Once Every week | Last 4 Backup(s)   | Objects + PV Snapshots |

#### Platform Tools backups

Stakater only takes backups of the managed applications:

| Tool                       | Backup Frequency |   Backup Retention   |
| ------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Nexus                      |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| Prometheus (Cluster)       |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| Prometheus (Applications)  |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| Elasticsearch              |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| Vault                      |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| SonarQube                  |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| CodeReadyWorkspaces        |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| RHSSO (Keycloak)           |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |
| ArgoCD                     |    Every 24 hrs   |   Last 3 Backup(s)   |

If you want to change backup frequency/retention times for your specific needs, contact support.

### Restore

Resources can be restored on demand. Please contact support and specify the following

* Time to restore back to.
* Namespaces to include/exclude from backup
* Resources to include/exclude from backup
* `labelSelector` to filter objects to restore
* Whether to include cluster resources or not
* Whether to restore PVs or not (Not applicable on Object Only Backups)

## Technical viewpoint

Stakater App Agility Platform uses managed Velero operator to provision the Velero server. This backup and restore process can be used for both disaster recovery and cluster migration.

### Backup

Using Schedules and Read-Only Backup Storage Locations & Volume Snapshot Locations.

First things first, Velero needs a BackupStorageLocation where backups can be stored
These are including the backup destination storage information

* BackupStorageLocation CR
ex:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: BackupStorageLocation
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-velero
  spec:
    config:
      region: eu-central-1
    objectStorage:
      bucket: *********
    provider: aws
```

* VolumeSnapshotlocation CR (Not needed when using CSI Plugin for backups)
ex:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: VolumeSnapshotLocation
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: openshift-velero
  spec:
    config:
      region: eu-central-1
    provider: aws
```

Then schedule the backup by using the backup locations and specifying the various filters for backup target.

* Create Schedule CR
ex:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Schedule
metadata:
  name: backup-schedule
  namespace: openshift-velero
  spec:
    schedule: 0 */6 * * *
    template:
      labelSelector:
        matchExpressions:
        * key: app
          operator: In
          values:
        * nexus
      includeClusterResources: true
      includedNamespaces:
      * '*'
      includedResources:
      * '*'
      snapshotVolumes: true
      storageLocation: default
      ttl: 24h0m0s
      volumeSnapshotLocations:
      * default
```

Or you can specify a single Backup using a backup CR.

* Create a Backup CR
ex:

```yaml
apiVersion: velero.io/v1
kind: Backup
metadata:
  name: data-backup
  namespace: openshift-velero
spec:
  includedNamespaces:
  * openshift-stakater-3scale
  includedResources:
  * '*'
  storageLocation: default
  ttl: 72h0m0s
  volumeSnapshotLocations:
  * default
```

#### Different Schedule Definitions and their meanings

Changing some parameters in Schedule CR, changes the backup behavior

* `snapshotVolumes`: (boolean)
    * `true` (makes Velero to take native volume snapshots)
    * `false` (no native Velero snapshots taken)
    * Not Specify (Defaults to auto behavior define within Velero)
  Note: You don't specify this parameter with Velero CSI plugin

* `includeClusterResources`: (boolean)
    * `true` (includes all cluster level resource, `snapshotVolumes` needs to be true to take PV snapshots)
    * `false` (exclude cluster level resources, including PVs. So there will be no snapshots)

* Excluding both `snapshotVolumes` and `includeClusterResources` will have default behavior of taking snapshots for only included namespaces PVs.

#### Backup target Filters

You can use [resource filtering](https://velero.io/docs/main/resource-filtering/) options to backup specific resources. Typical ones are following;

* `labelSelector`: Specify the labels for the backup target resources
   MatchExpression has several operators such as `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists` and `DoesNotExist`.
* `includeClusterResources`: (boolean) Set true to include cluster level resources like PV etc.
* `includedNamespaces`: Specify the namespaces in which backup target resources are included
* `includedResources`: Specify the resource types for the backup target resources
* `excludeNamespaces`: Specify the namespaces to exclude from backup
* `excludeResources`: Specify the resource types to exclude from backup
**NOTE**: You have to select the resource filters properly. For example, if the target application has cluster-scope resources, then you cannot use `--include-namespaces` only.

#### backup destination

* `snapshotVolumes`: (boolean) Set true for doing volume snapshots
* `storageLocation`: BackupStorageLocation CR name
* `volumeSnapshotLocations`: VolumeSnapshotlocation CR name

#### retention policy

* `ttl`: The backup retention period

### Restore

Restore on the same cluster or the other cluster in the case of cluster broken.
Update your backup storage location to read-only mode (this prevents backup objects from being created or deleted in the backup storage location during the restore process):

```yaml
kubectl patch backupstoragelocation <STORAGE LOCATION NAME> \
    --namespace openshift-velero \
    --type merge \
    --patch '{"spec":{"accessMode":"ReadOnly"}}'
```

Create a restore with your most recent Velero Backup:

```sh
velero restore create --from-backup <BACKUP NAME>
```

When ready, revert your backup storage location to read-write mode:

```sh
kubectl patch backupstoragelocation <STORAGE LOCATION NAME> \
   --namespace openshift-velero \
   --type merge \
   --patch '{"spec":{"accessMode":"ReadWrite"}}'
```

#### restore target filter

If you want to restore specific resources, you can use [resource filtering](https://velero.io/docs/main/resource-filtering/).
For example, you can restore resources in `web` namespace:

```sh
velero restore create --from-backup <BACKUP NAME> --include-namespaces web --namespace openshift-velero
```

!!! note
    You have to select the resource filters properly. For example, if the target application has cluster-scope resources, then you cannot use `--include-namespaces` only.
