    1. If Data are processed according to legal provisions and contrary to Controller instructions, the Processor must inform the Controller in advance of the processing operation and the lawfulness of processing, except when contrary to an important public interest. The Controller is accountable for evaluating the lawfulness of the Data processing and ensuring the rights of the data subjects are protected.

The Controller may object to the change within thirty (30) days if there is a valid reason. The objection must be in writing, specifying the reasons for the objection. Any further outsourcing by the subcontractor requires the express consent of the Controller.

    The Processor must ensure that authorized subcontractors have data protection obligations fundamentally comparable to those contained in this Agreement before processing Personal Data of the Controller.

    Subcontractors are service providers whose services are directly related to the provision of the main service under the Framework Agreement and concern the processing of Data. Ancillary services, such as telecommunications services, postal or transport services, maintenance and user service, or the disposal of data carriers, are excluded from this definition.
