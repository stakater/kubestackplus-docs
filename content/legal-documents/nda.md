1. **Introduction**

    The parties involved have the intention to collaborate in the field of consulting and operation of IT services. Prior to establishing any business relationship, it may be necessary for the parties to share confidential information with each other. To safeguard the interests of the disclosing party, such sensitive information shall be kept confidential and subject to a duty of confidentiality. This agreement shall remain valid even if the intended business relationship is not finalized.

    Both parties acknowledge that they have invested considerable resources in developing their respective intellectual property. Hence, there is a mutual interest in protecting each other's intellectual property and preventing unauthorized access by third parties.

    The party disclosing sensitive information reserves the right to seek industrial property rights related to the subject of the confidential information. The present agreement is entered into for this specific purpose.

1. **Definitions**

    The term "Contracting Parties" refers to the parties who are bound by this agreement on confidentiality.

    The term "Confidential Information" refers to all information shared between the parties, whether in written, oral, electronic, or any other form, which is explicitly marked as secret or confidential or can be recognized as such.

Additionally, the term includes the existence and contents of this agreement.

1. **Secrecy Agreement**

    The Confidential Information that has been provided to the Contracting Parties in writing, orally, or by any other means, directly or indirectly, for the Purpose outlined in the preamble or that has become known to them in any other way, is subject to the following obligations:

    1. To take all necessary precautions to prevent third-party access;
    1. To provide access solely to employees working in connection with the Purpose outlined in the preamble, who have also been bound by the aforementioned obligation of confidentiality. This remains applicable even after an employee leaves their position during the term and continued validity of this agreement.

1. **Exceptions to Secrecy Agreement**

    The obligations of confidentiality outlined in this agreement do not apply to information that:

    1. Has been independently developed by the Contracting Party, without reliance on the confidential information;
    1. Is lawfully provided or made accessible to the Contracting Party by a third party who is authorized to disclose it. It is the responsibility of the Contracting Party invoking these exceptions to provide evidence to support their claim.

1. **Restrictions and Prohibitions**

    The Contracting Parties shall exercise the utmost care in handling the Confidential Information received from the other Party. The Contracting Parties agree to handle the Confidential Information with due care, commensurate with their own affairs and the standard of care prevalent in similar matters, in order to prevent any unauthorized disclosure or use. The receiving Contracting Party acknowledges that monetary compensation may not be adequate to remedy a breach of confidentiality and that the disclosing party may seek injunctive relief available under the law, without forfeiting any other rights or remedies.
