# Renovate

Renovate is an open-source bot for automating dependency management in GitHub repositories. It helps to ensure that your project's dependencies are always up to date, reducing security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.

To set up Renovate bot for your GitHub repository, follow these steps:

Go to the Renovate website (https://renovatebot.com/) and click on "Get started for free".
Choose the "GitHub" option and grant access to your account.
Select the repository you want to use Renovate with and choose your preferred configuration options.
Review and confirm your settings, then save your configuration to create the bot.
Once the bot is set up, Renovate will monitor your repository and automatically create pull requests to update dependencies as needed. You can configure the bot to run on a schedule, or manually trigger it as needed.

The benefits of using Renovate include:

Improved security: Renovate helps keep your dependencies up to date, reducing the risk of security vulnerabilities.

Better compatibility: Renovate ensures that your project's dependencies are compatible with each other and with the latest version of your programming language or framework.

Reduced manual work: Renovate automates the process of dependency management, saving you time and effort.

Increased efficiency: With Renovate, you can ensure that your dependencies are always up to date without needing to constantly monitor and update them manually.

Stakater Nordmart Review repository contains a renovate.json file with the following configuration:

"```"
{
    "extends": [
      "config:base",
      ":disableRateLimiting",
      ":dependencyDashboard",
      ":rebaseStalePrs",
      ":renovatePrefix",
      ":separateMajorReleases",
      ":separateMultipleMajorReleases",
      ":separatePatchReleases"
    ],
    "packageRules": [
      {
        "matchUpdateTypes": ["major", "minor", "patch", "digest"],
        "matchPackagePatterns": ["*"],
        "automerge": false,
        "labels": [
          "all-dependencies-updates"
        ]
      }
    ],
    "rollbackPrs": true,
    "prConcurrentLimit": 4
  }
"```"

This is a configuration file for Renovate bot, which specifies how the bot should behave when updating dependencies in your repository.

The "extends" section indicates which preset configurations the file should inherit. In this case, it's extending the "base" configuration, as well as several other configurations such as disabling rate limiting, enabling a dependency dashboard, prefixing commit messages with "[Renovate]", and separating major, multiple major, and patch releases.

The "packageRules" section specifies which packages should be updated, and with what settings. In this case, it's set up to match all package patterns and update for any major, minor, patch, or digest updates, but not to automatically merge pull requests.

The "rollbackPrs" setting indicates that Renovate should automatically create a rollback pull request if any updated dependencies cause issues.

Finally, the "prConcurrentLimit" setting specifies how many pull requests Renovate should have open at the same time.

This configuration file helps to ensure that Renovate bot is set up to update dependencies in a controlled and predictable way, while also minimizing the risk of introducing issues into your repository.
