# GitOps Onboarding

Let us set up Stakater Opinionated GitOps Structure.

Stakater's GitOps structure is composed of two repositories; one for deploying infrastructural resources, and one for deploying the application workloads.

For the purpose of this tutorial, we will be using the name `infra-gitops-config` for the former repository and `apps-gitops-config` for the latter.
You can name these two repositories anything you want but make sure the names are descriptive.

Let's set these two repositories up!!

Objective:
Create your first tenant

Key Results:

- Create GitOps repository
- Tenant operator resources configured
- ArgoCD configured

## Infra GitOps Config

The cluster scoped infrastructural configurations are deployed through this repository.

To make things easier, we have created a [template](https://github.com/stakater/infra-gitops-config.git) that you can use to create your infra repository.

Team Stakater will create a root [Tenant](https://docs.stakater.com/mto/main/customresources.html#2-tenant), which will then create a root AppProject.
This AppProject will be used to sync all the Applications in `Infra Gitops Config` and it will provide visibility of these Applications in ArgoCD UI to customer cluster admins.

1. Open up your SCM and create any empty repository.

> Follow along GitHub/GitLab documentation for configuring other organization specific requirements set for source code repositories.

1. Create a secret with read permissions over this repository. Navigate to following section for more info [Configure Repository Secret for ArgoCD](../../how-to-guides/configure-repository-secret/configure-repository-secret.md). Provide this secret to stakater-admin for it to be deployed with your ArgoCD instance.
1. Now let's copy the structure that we saw in the [template](https://github.com/stakater/infra-gitops-config.git). Add a folder bearing your cluster's name say `dev` at the root of the repository that you just created.
    > If you plan on using this repository for multiple clusters, add a folder for each cluster.
1. Inside the folder created in step 2, add two folders; one named `argocd-apps`, and another one named `tenant-operator-config`
    > The `argocd-apps` folder will contain ArgoCD applications that will _watch_ different resources added to the same repository. Let's spare ourselves from the details for now.
1. Open the `tenant-operator-config` folder and add two folders inside it: `quotas` and `tenants`
1. The tenants folder will contain the tenant you want to add to your cluster. Let's create one called `gabbar` by adding the file below:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta1
    kind: Tenant
    metadata:
      name: gabbar
    spec:
      quota: gabbar-large
      owners:
        users:
        - abc@gmail.com
      argocd:
          sourceRepos:
          - 'https://github.com/your-organization/infra-gitops-config'
          - 'https://github.com/your-organization/apps-gitops-config'
      templateInstances:
      - spec:
          template: tenant-vault-access
          sync: true
      namespaces:
      - build
      - dev
      - stage
      specificMetadata:
      - namespaces:
          - gabbar-build
        annotations:
          openshift.io/node-selector: node-role.kubernetes.io/pipeline=
    ```

1. We also need to add a quota for our `gabbar` tenant in our `quotas` folder created in step 4. So let's do it using the file below. The name of this quota need to match the name you specified in tenant CR.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: tenantoperator.stakater.com/v1beta1
    kind: Quota
    metadata:
      name: gabbar-large
      annotations:
        quota.tenantoperator.stakater.com/is-default: "false"
    spec:
      resourcequota:
        hard:
          requests.cpu: "16"
          requests.memory: 32Gi
      limitrange:
        limits:
          - defaultRequest:
              cpu: 10m
              memory: 50Mi
            type: Container
    ```

1. Now that the quota and the tenant have been added, let's create an ArgoCD application in the `argocd-apps` folder that will point to these resources and help us deploy them.
Open up the `argocd-apps` folder and add the following file to it:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      name: CLUSTER_NAME-tenant-operator-config
      namespace: openshift-gitops
    spec:
      destination:
        namespace: openshift-gitops
        server: 'https://kubernetes.default.svc'
      source:
        path: CLUSTER_NAME/tenant-operator-config
        repoURL: 'INFRA_GITOPS_REPO_URL'
        targetRevision: HEAD
        directory:
          recurse: true
      project: root-tenant
      syncPolicy:
        automated:
          prune: true
          selfHeal: true
    ```

    Make sure you replace the `repoUrl` and all instances of `CLUSTER_NAME` with your cluster's name.
    If you notice the path, you will realize that this application is pointing to 'tenant-operator-config' folder housing your tenant and quotas.

1. Deploy an ArgoCD application on the cluster pointing to `<cluster-name>/argocd-apps` directory. You will need to ask Stakater Admin to create it as part of ArgoCD Instance.

1. Login to ArgoCD and check if `infra-gitops-config` application is present. Validate the child application `tenant-operator-config`.

We have set up the basic structure for our infra repository. Let's move on to the apps repository.
