# Observability

Enabling observability in the ArgoCD Custom Resource involves configuring and enabling Prometheus and Grafana, two popular monitoring and visualization tools, within your ArgoCD deployment. By enabling `prometheus` and `grafana` to "true" in the ArgoCD Custom Resource, you can activate and leverage the capabilities of Prometheus and Grafana for comprehensive observability.

With Prometheus and Grafana enabled, you can leverage the power of these tools to monitor the performance and health of your ArgoCD deployment. You can gain insights into resource utilization patterns, track synchronization and deployment metrics, and identify any potential bottlenecks or issues. The visualizations and dashboards offered by Grafana allow you to easily track and analyze the collected metrics, helping you make informed decisions and take proactive measures to optimize your continuous deployment workflows.
