# Overview

In the ever-evolving landscape of cloud-native applications, achieving dynamic scalability while maintaining cost-efficiency is paramount. Our Managed Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) addon, integrated within the Stakater App Agility Platform (SAAP), empowers your organization to seamlessly handle the growth and contraction of your Kubernetes workloads, ensuring optimal performance and resource utilization.

## What is Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)?

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a core feature of Kubernetes designed to automate the scaling of your application's pods (containers) based on resource utilization or custom metrics. HPA ensures that your application always has the right number of replicas to handle varying workloads, thus optimizing efficiency and performance.

## Key Features and Benefits

- **Automated Scalability**: HPA continuously monitors your applications and automatically scales the number of pods up or down to match the required resources, ensuring smooth performance and cost savings.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminate the need for manual intervention and reduce infrastructure costs by dynamically adjusting the number of pods based on demand.

- **High Availability**: HPA maintains the desired level of application availability by scaling pods to meet traffic demands, avoiding over-provisioning and resource wastage.

- **Custom Metrics Support**: Beyond standard resource-based scaling, HPA can also scale based on custom metrics, enabling more precise control over application performance.

- **Traffic Spikes Handling**: Adapt to sudden traffic spikes effortlessly, maintaining application responsiveness and user satisfaction.
