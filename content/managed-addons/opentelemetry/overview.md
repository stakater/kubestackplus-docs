# Overview

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is a powerful observability framework that enables the collection, processing, and export of telemetry data (logs, metrics, and traces) from distributed applications. In SAAP, OpenTelemetry is integrated to help teams gain deep insights into their applications' performance and behavior across Kubernetes clusters.

## Use Cases

- **Distributed Tracing:** Gain visibility into microservices-based applications to identify bottlenecks and improve performance.
- **Metrics Aggregation:** Monitor resource utilization, application health, and infrastructure performance.
- **Log Enrichment:** Collect and analyze logs alongside metrics and traces for full-stack observability.
