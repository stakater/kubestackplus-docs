# Overview

Each Stakater App Agility Platform (SAAP) instance comes with a pre-configured Crossplane Operator, enabling advanced infrastructure management and self-service capabilities. This setup is further supported by the Stakater Consulting team, who assist customers in configuring and optimizing Crossplane providers.

The Crossplane Operator in SAAP is designed to extend the capabilities of Kubernetes by enabling declarative management of cloud infrastructure and services. By using Crossplane, organizations can provision, manage, and consume cloud resources through Kubernetes manifests, promoting a seamless integration of infrastructure management within the Kubernetes ecosystem.
