# Overview

Tempo is a distributed tracing backend designed to provide seamless integration for applications running in modern containerized environments like Kubernetes. As part of the SAAP (Stakater App Agility Platform), Tempo enhances observability by offering detailed insights into service-to-service communication, helping teams identify and resolve performance bottlenecks, errors, and latency issues.

## What is Distributed Tracing?

Distributed tracing allows developers and operators to track the flow of requests across multiple services in a microservices architecture. It provides:

- **End-to-end visibility**: Understand how a request flows through your application.
- **Performance monitoring**: Identify slow components or bottlenecks.
- **Root cause analysis**: Pinpoint the source of errors or failures.
