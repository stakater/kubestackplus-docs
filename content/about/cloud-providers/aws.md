  |Type        | Limit |
  |------------|------------|
  | Virtual Machines | Varies. The limit should be 12 initially. (Initial deployment is 3 control plane + 3 infra + 3 worker)|
  | Regional vCPUs | The limit should be A x B x 2 , where A = no. of VMs (worker + infra + control plane), B = vCPUs per VM) |
  | Elastic IPs (EIPs) | 5 |
  | Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) | 5 |
  | Elastic Load Balancing (ELB/NLB) | 3 |
  | NAT Gateways | 5 |
