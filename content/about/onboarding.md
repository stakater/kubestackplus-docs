# Onboarding

Stakater provisions the Stakater App Agility Platform (SAAP) and takes first application to production in less than four weeks on the cloud of your choice!

## Customer Data Collected

This is a complete list of the customer data and permissions needed for getting started with SAAP:

* Stakater asks customer if they want logging enabled - logging is optional
* Stakater needs to know which cloud provider the customer is using
* Stakater asks the customer what Identity Provider is used for the cloud provider
* Stakater asks the customer to create a user in their cloud provider and download the credentials
* Stakater asks if the customer has any preference for their cluster name
* Stakater needs permissions to git repo access to set up pipelines - pipeline setup is optional

## Week 1 - Provisioning - Free

## Week 2-4 - Application Migration - Time and Material - Optional

* Select the first application or group of applications that work together
    * Setup infrastructure and application GitOps repositories for deploying application and dependent configurations
    * Setup tenant operator configuration and decide on the number of environments if required
    * Divide applications into microservices and containerize them
    * Deploy the application onto the cluster using Kubernetes Resources. List out secret required, dependent services, databases, storage requirements and implement them accordingly.

* Logs are retained for 7 days unless the customer requests otherwise
* In case customer wants to forward events to a data store they can do that optionally
