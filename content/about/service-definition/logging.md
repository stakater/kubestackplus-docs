# Logging

SAAP provides an optional integrated log forwarding to log store.

## Cluster Audit Logging

Cluster audit logs are available through log store, if the integration is enabled. If the integration is not enabled, you can request the audit logs by opening a [support ticket](https://support.stakater.com/index.html).

## Application Logging

Application logs sent to `STDOUT` are collected by log collector and forwarded to log store through the cluster logging stack, if it is installed.

## Data Retention

By default only 7 days data is kept; if you want to store data for longer then open a [support ticket](https://support.stakater.com/index.html).
