# Secrets Management

SAAP provides an optional integration of HashiCorp Vault which enhances the security and secrets management capabilities of the platform.

By integrating Vault, SAAP provides customers with a secure and centralized solution for storing and accessing sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates. It complements the default OpenShift secrets mechanism, providing additional features and capabilities that are critical for managing secrets in modern containerized environments.
