# Overview

## What is KubeStack+?

**KubeStack+** is a next-generation Kubernetes Application Platform that brings together everything your teams need to deliver, operate, and govern modern applications — faster and safer.

Built by practitioners who have operated large-scale Kubernetes environments for years, KubeStack+ transforms Kubernetes from a complex infrastructure layer into a governed, compliant, and developer-friendly platform.

At its core, it is:

> **Dev Ready. Ops Ready. Compliance Ready.**

## Why KubeStack+?

Organizations adopting Kubernetes often face three recurring challenges:

1. Developers spend too much time wiring pipelines and environments instead of shipping value.
1. Operations teams struggle to maintain consistency, security, and cost control across clusters.
1. Compliance and governance are treated as an afterthought — reactive, manual, and painful.

**KubeStack+** solves these by unifying the Dev, Ops, and Compliance experience into a single, automated platform.
It provides golden paths for developers, scalable automation for operators, and built-in governance for compliance teams — all working seamlessly together.

## Core Pillar

* **Dev Ready** — Accelerate delivery with pre-integrated CI/CD pipelines, golden templates, and self-service developer workspaces.
* **Ops Ready** — Run production workloads at scale with built-in multi-tenancy, observability, upgrades, and day-2 automation.
* **Compliance Ready** — Stay audit-ready with policy enforcement, security baselines, and evidence mapped to ISO 27001, NIS2, and DORA.

These three pillars form the foundation of the KubeStack+ experience — ensuring every team moves fast **without losing control.**

## Designed for Regulated and High-Trust Environments

KubeStack+ was built for organizations that demand both agility and assurance.
Whether you’re a financial institution, telcos, or public-sector agency, the platform embeds governance and data-sovereignty practices from the start — including EU-hosted options and clear shared-responsibility boundaries.

## From Code to Compliant in Hours

With KubeStack+, teams can go from a clean cluster to a fully governed, production-grade application environment in a matter of hours — not weeks.
That’s the power of being **Dev Ready, Ops Ready, and Compliance Ready** from day one.
