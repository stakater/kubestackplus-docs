DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) is a European Union regulation designed to ensure the resilience of financial entities against operational disruptions and cyber threats. SAAP plays a critical role in enabling compliance with DORA by leveraging Kubernetes features and configurations to address its requirements.

- **Total Articles in DORA**: 5
- **Key Provisions in DORA**: Multiple detailed requirements across areas such as ICT risk management, incident response, and third-party risk management.

## Provisions Addressed by SAAP

SAAP facilitates the implementation of critical provisions enforceable through Kubernetes configurations and features. These include:

- **ICT Risk Management Framework**: Leveraging Kubernetes features such as Pod Security Standards (PSS), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and audit logging to establish a robust ICT risk management framework.
- **Incident Response and Recovery**: Providing monitoring, logging, and disaster recovery capabilities using Kubernetes-native and compatible solutions for observability and backup.
- **Operational Resilience Testing**: Supporting resilience testing through tools and practices that align with chaos engineering principles and load testing methodologies.
- **Third-Party Risk Management**: Enforcing network isolation with Kubernetes NetworkPolicies and validating compliance through policy enforcement mechanisms.
- **Information Sharing**: Enabling secure data exchange via encryption, secure storage practices, and secrets management within Kubernetes.

SAAP addresses a substantial number of DORA provisions, empowering financial entities to align their Kubernetes-based workloads with regulatory requirements. By focusing on technical measures and leveraging Kubernetes capabilities, SAAP simplifies the path to operational resilience and compliance.
