# Technical and Organizational Security Measures

Stakater Cloud meet the specific requirements of data protection, including, without limitation, Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR and which are listed as SOC 2 Type 2 (Security & Confidentiality).

At a minimum, Stakater has implemented for the Stakater Cloud the technical and organizational measures and maintains security practices within the production environments as follows:

## Confidentiality of processing systems

### Identity and Access Management

- Role-based access controls are enforced using predefined security groups to segregate and manage data access to production systems.
- Administrative access to production systems is restricted to authorized personnel and granted solely based on their job roles and responsibilities.

### Audit Assurance: Compliance, Governance and Risk Management

- Stakater conducts annual security operational risk assessments for production applications and services. The findings are documented in a risk register, with identified risks prioritized for treatment based on their severity.
- Stakater evaluates the security of third-party vendors through a vendor security review, specifically focusing on vendors that store, process, or transmit Stakater and/or customer data.
- Stakater implements risk-based continuous control monitoring by performing control testing throughout the year using a structured methodology. Testing results are documented, reviewed by management, and accompanied by remediation plans for any identified issues.
- Controlled documents undergo annual review and approval by management, with updates communicated to relevant employees to ensure alignment and compliance.

### Human Resources

- Stakater team members complete security awareness training upon hire and annually thereafter. The training includes relevant Stakater security policies, instructions for reporting security incidents and general industry security best practices.
- Stakater new hires are required to pass a background check as a condition of their employment.

## Integrity of processing systems

### Application & Infrastructure Security

- Infrastructure and configuration management tools are employed to implement security hardening and establish standardized baseline configurations for production servers.
- Network traffic originating from or directed to untrusted networks is routed through a policy enforcement point, with firewall rules configured to block unauthorized access effectively.
- A centralized issue tracking system is utilized to manage, monitor, and document application and infrastructure changes throughout their lifecycle, from development to implementation.

### Threat and Vulnerability Management

- Stakater conducts regular vulnerability scans on the production environment to identify threats, assess their impact, and remediate findings based on severity.
- Continuous monitoring tools track security events, system latency, network performance, and physical server health in real time.
- Incident response procedures define steps for managing security events, including recovery and post-incident analysis to improve effectiveness.

## Availability of processing systems

### Resilience

- A business continuity plan is established to provide clear procedures for protecting operations against disruptions caused by unexpected events, with annual tabletop exercises conducted to validate its effectiveness.
- Enterprise monitoring tools are configured to track system capacity levels and promptly alert operations personnel when predefined thresholds are reached, ensuring proactive management of resources.

## Additional Considerations

- Stakater Cloud is designed to enable customers to delete their data when it is no longer needed.
- Digital Realty and OpenMetal are responsible for implementing controls to manage both physical access to servers and supporting infrastructure that host Stakater Cloud.
- Customers can choose to implement technical and organizational measures to safeguard their own (Red) data.
