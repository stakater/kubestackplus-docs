# Backup Strategy

The **3-2-1-1-0 Backup Rule** is a modern extension of the traditional backup strategy designed to ensure data protection and recovery. Here's what it stands for:

- **3:** Maintain at least three copies of your data (the original and two backups).
- **2:** Store the copies on two different types of media (e.g., local storage and external storage, or cloud storage and tape).
- **1:** Keep at least one of the backups offsite (for protection against physical disasters).
- **1:** Have at least one immutable backup copy or one backup that is air-gapped (meaning it cannot be tampered with or accessed online).
- **0:** Ensure there are zero errors in your backups by regularly testing and verifying them to confirm data integrity and successful recovery.

This rule provides a comprehensive approach to safeguarding against data loss due to hardware failure, natural disasters, cyberattacks, or human error.
