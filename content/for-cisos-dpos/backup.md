# Backup Strategy

The **3-2-1-1-0 Backup Rule** is a modern extension of the traditional backup strategy designed to ensure data protection and recovery. Here's what it stands for:

- **3 Copies of Your Data**: Keep three copies of your data: the primary data and two backups. This ensures redundancy.
- **2 Different Storage Types**: Store backups on at least two different types of media (e.g., disk and tape, or local and cloud) to avoid single points of failure.
- **1 Offsite Backup**: Keep one backup copy offsite, such as in a remote data center or a cloud service, to protect against local disasters.
- **1 Immutable Backup**: Have at least one backup that is immutable or air-gapped, ensuring it cannot be modified or deleted (e.g., WORM storage or offline backups).
- **0 Errors After Backup Verification**: Regularly verify and test backups to ensure they are error-free and can be restored when needed.

This rule provides a comprehensive approach to safeguarding against data loss due to hardware failure, natural disasters, cyberattacks, or human error.
