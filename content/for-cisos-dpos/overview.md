# CISOs and DPOs Guide Overview

At Stakater, compliance is not just a checkbox; it is a cornerstone of our philosophy. We understand the critical role that Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) play in safeguarding organizational integrity and building trust. With our **Risk and Compliance as Code (RCaC)** approach, we embed compliance practices directly into the infrastructure and workflows, ensuring that compliance becomes an automated, continuous process.

Through the Stakater App Agility Platform (SAAP), we provide our customers with the tools and capabilities necessary to achieve and maintain compliance effortlessly. Whether it’s adhering to GDPR, NIST, ISO 27001, BSI IT-Grundschutz  or other industry standards, SAAP empowers your teams with automated checks, auditable policies, and streamlined workflows to mitigate risks and stay compliant at all times. By leveraging our platform, organizations can focus on innovation and growth while ensuring that regulatory requirements are consistently met.

To explore specific compliance frameworks and how SAAP addresses them, it is essential to understand that these frameworks can be broadly divided into two major categories:

## 1. General Frameworks

These frameworks are widely applicable across industries and focus on providing high-level best practices for security, privacy, and risk management. They serve as foundational guidelines for building secure and compliant environments. SAAP supports measures aligned with frameworks such as:

- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27000 Series**, which outlines best practices for Information Security Management - [ISO270001](iso27k1.md)
- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-171**, focused on strengthening cybersecurity - [NIST SP 800 171](nist-sp-800-171.md)
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, which governs data privacy and protection in the European Union - [GDPR](gdpr-eu.md)
- **BSI IT-Grundschutz**, a comprehensive framework developed by the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) to ensure robust information security management - [BSI IT-Grundschutz](bsi-it-grundschutz.md)
- **Center for Internet Security (CIS) Benchmarks**, which provide globally recognized secure configuration guidelines for systems and applications - [CIS Benchmarks](cis.md)
- **SOC 2 Type 2**, is a framework which evaluates the operational effectiveness of an organization’s security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy controls over a defined period - [SOC 2 Type 2](soc2-type2.md)

## 2. Industry-Specific Standards

These standards focus on addressing the unique compliance, security, and operational requirements of specific industries. SAAP incorporates relevant measures that can be applied to help organizations meet compliance requirements in areas such as:

- Patient data protection - [HIPAA](hipaa.md)
- Operational resilience in financial services - [DORA)](dora.md)

SAAP provides a comprehensive approach to compliance by aligning with both industry-specific standards and general frameworks. The platform is designed to address these requirements efficiently, ensuring your organization remains secure and compliant.
