# CISOs and DPOs Guide Overview

At Stakater, compliance is not just a checkbox; it is a cornerstone of our philosophy. We understand the critical role that Data Protection Officers (DPOs) and Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) play in safeguarding organizational integrity and building trust. With our Risk and Compliance as Code (RCaC) approach, we embed compliance practices directly into the infrastructure and workflows, ensuring that compliance becomes an automated, continuous process.

Through the Stakater App Agility Platform (SAAP), we provide our customers with the tools and capabilities necessary to achieve and maintain compliance effortlessly. Whether itâ€™s adhering to GDPR, NIST, ISO 27001, BSI IT-Grundschutz  or other industry standards, SAAP empowers your teams with automated checks, auditable policies, and streamlined workflows to mitigate risks and stay compliant at all times. By leveraging our platform, organizations can focus on innovation and growth while ensuring that regulatory requirements are consistently met.
