# Plan your environment

Getting started with cluster creation, you need to first

- Determine the number of nodes required for your cluster, based on the workload and availability requirements.
- Identify the type of nodes required, such as master, worker, infra, and storage nodes.
- Determine the networking requirements, including the IP address range, DNS configuration, and network policies.
- Determine the storage requirements, including the type of storage needed, such as block, file, or object storage.

See [Resource requirements for SAAP installation](./requirements.md) for more details.
