## Compute

### 3 x Master

The control plane, which is composed of master nodes, also known as the control plane, manages the SAAP cluster. The control plane nodes run the control plane. No user workloads run on master nodes.

### 2 x Infra

At least two infrastructure nodes are required for the SAAP infrastructure workloads:

### 2 x Monitoring

Monitoring components to monitor `SAAP workloads` and user workloads are deployed on monitoring nodes. The monitoring stack includes the Prometheus stack (Prometheus, Grafana and Alertmanager).

Minimum two monitoring node must be used for all production deployments.

| Type of monitoring | SAAP component | vCPU requirement (m) | Memory requirement (GiB) |
|---|:---|---:|---:|
| **Infrastructure** |   |  | |
| | [Alertmanager](https://github.com/prometheus/alertmanager)   | 500 | 1.00 |

| | [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus) | 100 | 2.50 |
| **Total**|    | **3290** | **12.15** |

No user workloads run on monitoring nodes.

### 1 x Logging (optional)

Logging components aggregate all logs and store them centrally. These components run on logging nodes. The logging stack includes the EFK stack (Elasticsearch, Fluentd and Kibana).

The logging pool is optional, if there is no need for it, it will not be deployed. Logging infrastructure is still highly recommended for troubleshooting purposes.

Minimum one logging node is required. For high availability consider using three logging nodes.

| SAAP component | vCPU requirement (m) | Memory requirement (GiB) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Collector | 200 | 2.0 |
| [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) | 500 | 4.0 |
| [Fluentd](https://github.com/fluent/fluentd) | 20 | 0.6 |
| [Kibana](https://github.com/elastic/kibana)| 300 | 0.5 |
| **Total** | **1020** | **7.1** |

No user workloads run on logging nodes.

### 1 x Pipeline (optional)

Pipeline nodes hold pods running for Tekton based CI/CD pipelines.

The pipeline pool is optional, if there is no need for it, it will not be deployed.

Minimum requirements for pipeline infrastructure is:

| SAAP component | vCPU requirement (m) | Memory requirement (GiB) |
|---|---:|---:|
| OpenShift pipelines | 100 | 0.2 |

No user workloads run on pipelines nodes.

### 3 x Worker

In a SAAP cluster, users run their applications on worker nodes. By default, a SAAP subscription comes with three worker nodes.

## Storage

### Block Storage

SAAP uses high performance disks i.e. `SSDs` for storage requirements which includes:

- Boot Volumes (attached to nodes for OS)
- Persistent Volumes (Additionally attached volumes for application consumption)

Following are the storage requirements used as Persistent Volumes consumed by `SAAP workloads`:

| SAAP component | Volume Size (GiB) |
|---|---:|
| Elasticsearch Logging | 300  |
| Nexus | 100 |
| Prometheus - Infrastructure Monitoring | 100  |
| Prometheus - workload Monitoring| 100 |
| SonarQube | 15 |
| Vault | 10 |
| **Total** | **625** |

### Object Storage

`1 x Object storage bucket` is required for keeping Backups of Kubernetes Objects.

### Volume Snapshot Requirements

Volume Snapshots are backups of volumes for critical `SAAP workloads` that only include `Nexus` and `Vault`

By default backups are taken daily and are retained for 3 days. So at a given instance 3 day old backups for `SAAP workloads` are kept.

| SAAP component | PV size | backup frequency | Backup size (GiB) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Nexus | 100 | 3 | 300 |
| Vault | 10 | 3 | 30 |
| **Total** | | | **330** |

## Network

### Load Balancers

#### For AWS, Azure, GCP

Each SAAP cluster deploys `3 x Loadbalancers`:

- 2 x Public (for cluster API and cluster dashboard)

- 1 x Private (for control plane communication)

#### For OpenStack

No LoadBalancers required.

### Floating IPs

#### For AWS, Azure, GCP

No additional Floating IPs/Public IPs are required.

#### For OpenStack

`2 x Floating IPs` are required (for cluster API and cluster dashboard).
