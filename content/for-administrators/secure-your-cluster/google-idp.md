# Configuring a Google identity provider

To enable login with Google you first have to create a project and a client in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project).

1. Log in to the Google [Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/project)

1. Google requires some basic information about the product before creating any secrets for it. For a new project, you have first to configure `OAuth consent screen`. Fill in `OAuth consent screen` details. Keep the **Application Type** `Internal`. Add the `email`, `profile` and `openid` in the allowed **Scopes**. Under **Authorized domains** add `kubeapp.cloud` along with any hosted domain(s) which you want to allow. e.g if Authorized domain is `xyz.com` then `bob@xyz.com` will be allowed
