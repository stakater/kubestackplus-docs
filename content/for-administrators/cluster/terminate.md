# Cluster Termination Process

Terminating an OpenShift cluster is an irreversible process, and it should only be done if there is a specific need to do so, such as decommissioning the cluster or moving to a new platform. Make sure to back up any important data and configurations that may be needed later. Stakater needs a formal request from you with planned date and time for cluster termination.
